##  technical setup

The main website and its files are hosted on the branch "website" of our repository. All assets of the website (including javascript code, styling, images and external libraries) are found under "assets" folder while all the employed data for our visualisations is found under "data". 

There are 3 separate js files for the 3 different visualisations. 

To launch our website, you can simply click on the above link. 

## intended usage

Simply launch the website and begin reading through from the beginning ! Our website is a continuous single scrowl which allows for smooth transition between the different sections of our website -- namely for naive users, statisticians and for hosts.
