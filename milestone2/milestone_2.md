### Introduction:
The goal of our project is to provide a platform for both Airbnb users and Airbnb listing owners (also known as hosts) in Switzerland. Since the tourism industry has been hit harshly with COVID restrictions, our approach is twofold. On one hand, we aim to inform the Airbnb community about advantages to coming to Switzerland for near-future stays. On the other, we bring regional statistics and inputs one click away perfect for owners to learn about their listing’s environment. 

The entirety of our website will be accessible to both types of users. However, there will be two explicitly-labeled sections separate for users and owners. 

### Sketches and tools needed:
Before the interactive visualizations,  our site will exhibit general statistics pertaining to the three regions (Vaud, Geneva and Zurich) and Airbnb information. Because the goal is to “relaunch” Swiss tourism,  the subsequent section will contain the announced “deconfinement” timeline outlined in the Federal Council's proposal (unfortunately, it’s not available in english). 
From there, we will have two buttons leading to the “insights for users” or “insights for hosts”.  Our mainframe work will contain 3 principle visualisation:
